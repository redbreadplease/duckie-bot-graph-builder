# Use only GraphBuilder class. Do not change variables.

Methods to use:
- .get_next_turn(vertex_qr_code: int, turns_qr_code: int)
  It returns values: -1 - stop robot; 0 - turn left; 1 - go straight; 2 - turn right

- .visualize() (But it won't work on duckiebot :( But, after robot stops, we're able to see what edges links what vertexes)
  It returns nothing
